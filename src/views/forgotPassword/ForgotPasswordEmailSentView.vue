        <p>Almost there! We've just sent an email with a verification link to your inbox. Click on that link, and you'll be one step closer to joining MiZaWra. If you don't see our email, be sure to peek in your spam folder too!</p>
        <p>Remember, every word you write brings you a step closer to... well, you! Happy writing!</p>
        <p>*Or maybe it's a step away from yourself. Oh no, thatâ€™s not what we want! Think of it like peeling an onion. Yes, there might be some tears, but each layer brings you closer to the heart of... hopefully... something. Or, you know, grab that onion and embark on an epic quest to find the perfect skillet where your stories truly sizzle!</p>
        <p>**Anyway: Happy writing!</p>
